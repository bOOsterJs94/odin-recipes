    <h2>What Is Schnitzel?</h2>
    <p style="width: 800px;">Schnitzel, which originated in Eastern Europe, is a thin slice of meat that is breaded and fried. You can make it with chicken, pork, veal (wiener-schnitzel), and other types of meat. The word "schnitzel" comes from the German word "schnitt," which means "cut."</p>

    <h2>How to Make Chicken Schnitzel</h2>
    <p style="width: 800px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare the Pan</li>
            <p style="width: 800px;">Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot before the meat even touches it — this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking.</p>
            <li>Prepare the Chicken</li>
            <p style="width: 800px;">Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</p>
            <li>Prepare the Breading and Dredge</li>
            <p style="width: 800px;">Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and lemon zest. Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture.</p>
            <li>Cook and Serve</li>
