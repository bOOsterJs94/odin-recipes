    <h2>Baked Chicken Schnitzel</h2>
    <p><a href="./recipes/bakedchickenschnitzel.html">See details</a></p>

    <p style="width: 800px;">Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup. The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.</p>

    <h2>Braised Beef</h2>
    <p><a href="./recipes/braisedbeef.html">See details</a></p>

    <p style="width: 800px;">An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>
